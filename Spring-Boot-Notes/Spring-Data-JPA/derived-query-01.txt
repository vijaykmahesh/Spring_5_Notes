	In case of JPA we need not write query instead spring will write the query by parsing 
	the methods i,e.
	
	Example: Employee findByName(String name);
	
	
	when above method is executed then springboot is parsing the above method like 
	
	find(keyword) ==> select
	By(keyword) ==> where 
	Name ==> It is property which is present in Entity class.
	
	Can we write whatever we want ? no we can't write since springboot can't understand it i,e 
	
	Employee hello(); // we will be getting error since springboot can't parse the method.

	But if we don't want springboot to parse the method and 
	generate query then we can use below way:
	
	
	a) @Query(value="Select * from employees where name=:name",nativeQuery=true)
	   Employee hello(String name);
	
	The above query is Native query i,e 
	
	employees ==> tableName
	employee_name ==> fieldName in Table
	
	b) @Query(value="FROM Employee where name=:name")  // by default nativeQuery is false
	   Employee hello(String name);
	   
	   
	
	The above query is JPQL query i,e 
	
	Employee ==> EntityName
	name ==> propertyName in Entity.
