	For each and every operation we have to write this line:
	----------------------------------------------------------
	session.beginTransaction();
	session.getTransaction().commit();
	
	@Transactional annotation helps us to maintain transaction and we can avoid writting above two lines of code always.
	
	Whenever method is called spring will maintain transaction behind the scene.i,e 
	spring will automatically open and close transaction.
	
	
	Whenever we use @Transactional on top of method we should define below method inside config class or else we 
	will be getting below exception i,e 
	
	could not obtain transaction-synchronized session for current thread
	
	@Bean
	public HibernateTransactionManager transactionManager(){
		
		HibernateTransactionManager manager = new HibernateTransactionManager();
		manager.setSessionFactory(sessionFactory);
		
		return manager;
	}
	
	and mark config class as @EnableTransactionManagement.
