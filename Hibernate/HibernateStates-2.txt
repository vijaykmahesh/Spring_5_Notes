	Transient
	----------
	The transient state is the first state of an entity object.When we instantiate an object of a POJO class using the new operator then the object is in the transient state. 
	This object is not connected with any hibernate session. As it is not connected to any Hibernate Session, So this state is not connected to any database table. 
	So, if we make any changes in the data of the POJO Class then the database table is not altered. Transient objects are independent of Hibernate, and they exist in the heap memory.
	
	Below Example:
	-------------
		Song song1 = new Song();
		song1.setSongName("SDSDFSFDSFD");
		song1.setArtist("SWEWREWE");
	
	Persistant
	------------
	Once the object is connected with the Hibernate Session then the object moves into the Persistent State.
	
	Below Example:
	-----------------
		session.save(song1);
	
	Detached
	----------
	For converting an object from Persistent State to Detached State, we either have to close the session or we have to clear its cache. 
	As the session is closed here or the cache is cleared, then any changes made to the data will not affect the database table. 
	
	Below Example:
	------------------
	session.close();
	
	Once the session is closed Object is in Detached state i,e session object is destroyed but object inside that is not destroyed.
	
	Removed
	--------
	Entity is completely removed.
