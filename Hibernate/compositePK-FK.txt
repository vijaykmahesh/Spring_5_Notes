	Assume in a table their won't be ID given how will u make PK?
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	We can combine 2 columns to make PK i,e called composite PK.
	
	Assume Student has three columns i,e student_name, mobile_no, age and country.
	
	PK as --> student_name + country.
	
	1st approach
	---------------
	a) mark the fields as @Id which u want to make as composite Pk.
	b) Create new class which implements Serializable i,e example (StudentId)
	c) On top of entity class declare annotation called @IdClass(StudentId.class)
	
	If we want to fetch the student now we have to fetch it based on student_name and country i,entity
		
		Student student = session.get(Student.class, new StudentId("vijay", "Ind"));
		System.out.println(student.getMobile_no()); // fetch student mobile_no.
		
		
	2nd approach
	--------------
	a) Create new class which implements Serializable i,e example (StudentPrimaryKey) and on top of class use @Embeddable.
		Declare student_name and country variables (since we need composite PK )
		add a default and using fields constructor, overide hashcode and equals method.
		
	b) Inside entity class declare variable  StudentPrimaryKey and on top of that use @EmbeddedId annotation.
		add a default and using fields constructor.
		
	While saving Student entity class:
	------------------------------------
		
		StudentPrimaryKey studentPrimaryKey = new StudentPrimaryKey("abhi", "US");

		Student student = new Student(studentPrimaryKey);

		student.setMobile_no(9066462166L);
		student.setAge(25);
		
		session.save(student);
		
		
	For Fetching from DB
	-----------------------
		
		Student student = session.get(Student.class, new StudentPrimaryKey("vijay", "Ind"));
		System.out.println(student.getMobile_no());
